# Data Processing and Modeling: Examples

This folder contains complementary examples in which the guidelines and snippets from [`../README.md`](../README.md) and [`../data_processing.py`](../data_processing.py) are used.

I will grow the collection as I come up with cases which are noteworthy.

Examples (see header docstrings for more information):

- [`etl_gdp.py`](./etl_gdp.py): Example in which an ETL pipeline is developed.
- [`ml_nlp_pipeline.py`](./ml_nlp_pipeline.py): Example in which a Machine Learning Pipeline is developed; it contains typical NLP pipeline and the model is trained using a `Pipeline` embedded in a `GridSearchCV`.
