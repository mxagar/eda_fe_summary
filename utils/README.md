## How to Use This Project

The directory of the project consists of the following files:

```
.
├── Instructions.md           # Original challenge instructions
...
```

You can run the notebook at leas in two ways:

1. In a custom environment, e.g., locally or on a container. To that end, you can create a [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment and install the [dependencies](#installing-dependencies-for-custom-environments) as explained below.
2. In Google Colab. For that, simply click on the following link:

### Installing Dependencies for Custom Environments

If you'd like to control where the notebook runs, you need to create a custom environment and install the required dependencies. A quick recipe which sets everything up with [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) is the following:

```bash
# Create environment with YAML, incl. packages
conda env create -f conda.yaml
conda activate env-name

# Install pip dependencies
pip install requirements.txt

# Track any changes and versions you have
conda env export > conda_.yaml
pip freeze > requirements_.txt
```
